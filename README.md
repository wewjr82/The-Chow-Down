<h1>The Chow Down</h1>
<p>The Chow Down was originally a mockup of a restaurant website that was created using HTML and CSS. I decided to convert it into a React mockup, which will allow me to add more interactivity and dynamic content in the near future.</p>

Link to project: https://scintillating-nasturtium-ccd6d8.netlify.app

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: React.js & Tailwind CSS</p>

<p>I created The Chow Down using the React.js frontend framework and the Tailwind CSS utility-first CSS framework. These frameworks allowed me to to create The Chow Down in a short amount of time and with a high degree of quality. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>Creating The Chow Down was a great way to challenge myself and learn more about React. I was able to familiarize myself with props, state, and useState, which are all important concepts in React. I also learned a lot about Tailwind CSS, which is a great CSS framework for creating responsive and reusable components. I am excited to continue using React and Tailwind CSS in my future web development projects. I believe that these frameworks are powerful tools that can be used to create high-quality web applications.</p>


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
